# Product-Market-Fit-Research-for-Air-Purifier-Development
Resume project challenge conducted by Codebasics-[Challenge Link](https://codebasics.io/challenge/codebasics-resume-project-challenge).
“AirPure Innovations” is a startup born out of the air quality crisis in India, with 14 cities ranking among the world’s top 20 most polluted urban centers. The company is in the early stages of product development and is unsure whether there is a strong, sustained demand for its air purifier product. Before committing to production and R&D, they need to answer critical questions:

* What pollutants or particles should their air purifier target?
* What are the most essential features that should be incorporated into the air purifier?
* Which cities have the highest demand for air purifiers, and what is the market size in these regions?
* How can R&D be aligned with localized pollution patterns?

* Top 2 & bottom 2 prominent pollutants for each southern Indian state (post-COVID: 2022 onwards).
* Weekend vs weekday AQI comparison in Indian metro cities over the past year.
* Months with consistently worst air quality across top 10 states with most distinct areas.
* Bengaluru air quality category counts (Good, Moderate, Poor, etc.) between Mar–May 2025.
* Top 2 most reported disease illnesses per state (past 3 years) with corresponding average AQI.
* Top 5 states with high EV adoption vs low EV adoption — AQI comparison.
* Most affected age group by air pollution-related health outcomes, with city-level variation.
* Major competitors in Indian air purifier market and their key differentiators (price, filtration stages, smart features).
* Relationship between population size & AQI — 2024 city population vs AQI data analysis.
* Most impactful pollution control policies by the Indian government in past 5 years and their regional/city-level differences in results.

# Insights
* Average AQI across states ranges from 3 to 500, with 95% of records linked to states where vehicles have not adopted EVs.
* Year-over-year AQI change shows an improvement of –4.8%.
* AQI levels spike post-October, peaking in November and December before gradually rising further.
* Delhi records the highest average AQI at 238, while the Andaman & Nicobar Islands report the lowest AQI.
* Metro cities show no significant difference in AQI between weekends and weekdays.
* EV adoption rates generally show no strong correlation with AQI at the city level, except in states like Mizoram, where high EV adoption coincides with low AQI.
* 2025 records the highest AQI in tier-1 cities, with Delhi topping the list.
* Severity rate (deaths per cases) rose until 2024, then declined in 2025 — peaking at 0.7% in Nagaland, followed by Goa and Gujarat.
* 2024 data shows no clear correlation between population size and AQI — air quality remains relatively constant despite population increases.
* Respiratory diseases affect 20% of the population.
* The average gap between outbreak onset and case reporting is approximately 5 days.
* Government initiatives over the last 5 years allocated a total budget of ₹5,520 crores, primarily in metro cities — with Mumbai receiving the highest allocation (₹2,000 crores) and Delhi following (₹1,400 crores).
* AQI trends over the last 3 years show decreases in Mumbai and Bengaluru, suggesting a potential positive impact of interventions.
* Demographics most affected by respiratory diseases: urban adults, followed by children, then senior citizens.
* High-risk states (based on AQI, population, and severity rate): Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra — with Gujarat projected to have the highest population growth rate (4.88% by 2035).
* Air purifier market analysis: Dyson is the premium segment leader (₹30K–₹55K), while the average market price for other brands is around ₹22K.
* Consumer behavior insights (Delhi, 2023): AQI spikes in October–December correlate with higher purifier sales and increased Google search interest, indicating demand surges during high pollution months.

# Recommendations
1. Market Focus & Segmentation – Prioritize high-AQI metros and high-risk states with tailored offerings: premium for affluent urban markets, mid-range for emerging high-AQI regions, and eco-lifestyle positioning in high-EV states.
2. Seasonal & Demographic Targeting – Leverage Oct–Dec pollution peaks with pre-season campaigns, affordability options, and variants designed for vulnerable groups like children and seniors.
3. Competitive & Feature Differentiation – Fill the gap between premium and mid-tier brands by offering smart-featured purifiers at a competitive price, emphasizing low maintenance costs and filter longevity.
4. Partnerships & Data-Driven Strategy – Align with government health initiatives in high-budget cities and use AQI trend forecasting plus online behavior data to optimize inventory and marketing spend.
