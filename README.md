# Product-Market-Fit-Research-for-Air-Purifier-Development
Resume project challenge conducted by Codebasics-[Challenge Link](https://codebasics.io/challenge/codebasics-resume-project-challenge).
“AirPure Innovations” is a startup born out of the air quality crisis in India, with 14 cities ranking among the world’s top 20 most polluted urban centers. The company is in the early stages of product development and is unsure whether there is a strong, sustained demand for its air purifier product. Before committing to production and R&D, they need to answer critical questions:

* What pollutants or particles should their air purifier target?
* What are the most essential features that should be incorporated into the air purifier?
* Which cities have the highest demand for air purifiers, and what is the market size in these regions?
* How can R&D be aligned with localized pollution patterns?
